# Installing graphical and media tools

## Configure wayland compositor

Install wayland compositor of your choice to enable graphical applications. I recommend using [Hyprland][Hyprland]. To install it, emerge the required packages:

```sh
sudo emerge --ask gui-wm/hyprland
```

It will likely ask you to update `/etc/portage/package.use/installkernel`. To confirm the update, run:

```sh
sudo etc-update
```

Then type:

```sh
1
1
yes
```

Then try to emerge again, this time everything should be fine.

### Update profile

Add the following lines to your `.zprofile`:

```sh
TODO

dbus-run-session Hyprland
```

And restart the current session. Run the following command to make sure that changes were applied:

```sh
echo $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
```

### Configure seatd

Enable the following flags for `seatd` package:

```sh
echo "sys-auth/seatd builtin server" | sudo tee /etc/portage/package.use/seatd
```

Then reinstall `seatd` package:

```sh
sudo emerge --ask sys-auth/seatd
```

Add your user to `seat` group:

```sh
sudo gpasswd -a zeio seat
```

Then start `seatd`:

```sh
sudo rc-service seatd start
```

And make it start automatically on boot:

```sh
sudo rc-update add seatd default
```

Now you can start `hyprland` using command:

```sh
dbus-run-session Hyprland
```
